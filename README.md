# jackbox-brute
Developed in Python to brute force the JackBox.tv API to see whether a room exists or not.

# features
Threading - letting users input the value of how many threads they wish to use.
Hits - letting the users know wheter a code is valid or not.

# packages
Requests - used to ofcourse connect to the api and parse the needed data.
Threading - to make the script as fast as possible!

# other info
Used fiddler to scrape the required API. I noticed the site has no rate limit, so you can run on as much threads as you wish without any worry about being banned! (Last checked: 05/09/2020). No proxies required!
